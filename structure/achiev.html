		<div class="overlay">Medals from Grade 7 to Grade 12 at ACSCI. During my HighSchool days, coping up at the lessons, quizzes and activies at first is wasn't easy for me because I struggle to learn every
lessons that my teacher have thought me. I failed a lot of quizzes and sometimes the subject. But I said to myself that I need to focus, I need to study to make my family proud. And as year goes by, things
became much easier for me and I didn't do it alone, with the help of my friends we all successfully graduated from highschool.</div>
